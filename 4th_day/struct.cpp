//Initializing structs by assigning values member by member is a little cumbersome, 
//so C++ supports a faster way to initialize structs using an initializer list. 
//This allows you to initialize some or all the members of a struct at declaration time.
//In C++11, we can also use uniform initialization:
int main(){
	Employee viv = {777,25,50000000000.00};//intializer list
	Employee meh {666,26,1234256.99};//In C++11, we can also use uniform initialization:
	Employee vivmeh {123,20};//vivmeh wage will take default intialization i.e 0
