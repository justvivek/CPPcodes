/*	Logical XOR is a logical operator provided in some languages 
 * 	that is used to test whether an odd number of conditions is true.
 * 	C++ doesnâ€™t provide a logical XOR operator
 * 	we can easily mimic logical XOR using the not equals operator (!=):
 * Note that the above XOR patterns only work if the operands are booleans (not integers).
 *  If you want this to work with integers, you can static_cast them to bools.
