/*The void pointer, also known as the generic pointer, is a special type of 
* pointer that can be pointed at objects of any data type! 
* A void pointer is declared like a normal pointer, using the void keyword as the pointerâ€™s type
* However, because the void pointer does not know what type of object it is pointing to, 
* it cannot be dereferenced directly! Rather, the void pointer must first be 
* explicitly cast to another pointer type before it is dereferenced.
*/

/* difference between a void pointer and a null pointer?
 * A void pointer is a pointer that can point to any type of object,
 * but does not know what type of object it points to.
 * A void pointer must be explicitly cast into another type of pointer to be dereferenced.
 * A null pointer is a pointer that does not point to an address. A void pointer can be a null pointer.
