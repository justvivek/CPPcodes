Function overloading provides a better solution. Using function overloading, we can simply declare another add() function that takes double parameters:

double add(double x, double y)
{
    return x + y;
}
We now have two version of add():

int add(int x, int y); // integer version
double add(double x, double y); // floating point version

Function return types are not considered for uniqueness

You might be tempted to do this:

int getRandomValue();
double getRandomValue();
But the compiler will flag this as an error.

Typedefs are not distinct

Since declaring a typedef does not introduce a new type, the following two declarations of Print() are considered identical:

typedef char *string;
void print(string value);
void print(char *value);



When an overloaded function is called, C++ goes through the following process to determine which version of the function will be called:

1) First, C++ tries to find an exact match. This is the case where the actual argument exactly matches the parameter type of one of the overloaded functions. For example:

void print(char *value);
void print(int value);
 
print(0); // exact match with print(int)
Although 0 could technically match print(char*) (as a null pointer), it exactly matches print(int). Thus print(int) is the best match available.

2) If no exact match is found, C++ tries to find a match through promotion. In lesson 4.4 -- type conversion and casting, we covered how certain types can be automatically promoted via internal type conversion to other types. To summarize,

Char, unsigned char, and short is promoted to an int.
Unsigned short can be promoted to int or unsigned int, depending on the size of an int
Float is promoted to double
Enum is promoted to int

For example:

void print(char *value);
void print(int value); 
print('a'); // promoted to match print(int)

3) If no promotion is possible, C++ tries to find a match through standard conversion. Standard conversions include:

Any numeric type will match any other numeric type, including unsigned (eg. int to float)
Enum will match the formal type of a numeric type (eg. enum to float)
Zero will match a pointer type and numeric type (eg. 0 to char*, or 0 to float)
A pointer will match a void pointer

For example:

struct Employee; // defined somewhere else
void print(float value);
void print(Employee value);
 
print('a'); // 'a' converted to match print(float)
In this case, because there is no print(char), and no print(int), the ‘a’ is converted to a float and matched with print(float).

Note that all standard conversions are considered equal. No standard conversion is considered better than any of the others.

4) Finally, C++ tries to find a match through user-defined conversion. Although we have not covered classes yet, classes (which are similar to structs) can define conversions to other types that can be implicitly applied to objects of that class. For example, we might define a class X and a user-defined conversion to int.

class X; // with user-defined conversion to int
 
void print(float value);
void print(int value);
 
X value; // declare a variable named value of type class X
print(value); // value will be converted to an int and matched to print(int)
Although value is of type class X, because this particular class has a user-defined conversion to int, the function call print(value) will resolve to the Print(int) version of the function.

We will cover the details on how to do user-defined conversions of classes when we cover classes.

Rule: use function overloading to make your program simpler.
*************************************************************************************************************
Ambiguous matches

If every overloaded function has to have unique parameters, how is it possible that a call could result in more than one match? Because all standard conversions are considered equal, and all user-defined conversions are considered equal, if a function call matches multiple candidates via standard conversion or user-defined conversion, an ambiguous match will result. For example:

void print(unsigned int value);
void print(float value);
 
print('a');
print(0);
print(3.14159);
In the case of print('a'), C++ can not find an exact match. It tries promoting ‘a’ to an int, but there is no print(int) either. Using a standard conversion, it can convert ‘a’ to both an unsigned int and a floating point value. Because all standard conversions are considered equal, this is an ambiguous match.

print(0) is similar. 0 is an int, and there is no print(int). It matches both calls via standard conversion.

print(3.14159) might be a little surprising, as most programmers would assume it matches print(float). But remember that all literal floating point values are doubles unless they have the ‘f’ suffix. 3.14159 is a double, and there is no print(double). Consequently, it matches both calls via standard conversion.

Ambiguous matches are considered a compile-time error. Consequently, an ambiguous match needs to be disambiguated before your program will compile. There are two ways to resolve ambiguous matches:

1) Often, the best way is simply to define a new overloaded function that takes parameters of exactly the type you are trying to call the function with. Then C++ will be able to find an exact match for the function call.

2) Alternatively, explicitly cast the ambiguous parameter(s) to the type of the function you want to call. For example, to have print(0) call the print(unsigned int), you would do this:

print(static_cast<unsigned int>(0)); // will call print(unsigned int)
